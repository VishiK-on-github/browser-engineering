## Questions

Noting some questions I have along the way:

- Can a page be fetched from the browsers local cache without reaching out to a server multiple time, maybe for less frequently changing content?
- How are adversarial attacks mitigated by browser some areas: memory/resource access, credential stealing, loading corrupted js scripts
- How is rendering of websites made faster by browsers?
- What networking optimizations are used in browsers?
